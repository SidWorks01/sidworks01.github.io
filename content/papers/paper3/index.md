summary: "Accepted at RegNLP @ COLING 2025 | Secured 3rd position in the workshop. Our system for the COLING 2025 FMD challenge focused on detecting financial misinformation using large language models (Qwen, Mistral, Gemma-2) combined with pre-processing and sequential learning. It not only classified fraudulent content with an F1-score of 0.8283 but also generated clear explanations, achieving a ROUGE-1 score of 0.7253. This work demonstrates the potential of LLMs in combating financial misinformation, improving transparency, and highlights areas for future enhancements in robustness and domain adaptation."

##### Abstract

This paper presents the system description of our entry for the COLING 2025 FMD challenge, focusing on misinformation detection in financial domains. We experimented with a combination of large language models, including Qwen, Mistral, and Gemma-2, and leveraged pre-processing and sequential learning for not only identifying fraudulent financial content but also generating coherent, and concise explanations that clarify the rationale behind the classifications. Our approach achieved competitive results with an F1-score of 0.8283 for classification, and ROUGE-1 of 0.7253 for explanations. This work highlights the transformative potential of LLMs in financial applications, offering insights into their capabilities for combating misinformation and enhancing transparency while identifying areas for future improvement in robustness and domain adaptation.
