summary: "Accepted at FINLP-FNP-LLMFinLegal @ COLING 2025 | Secured 4th position in the workshop. Our system for the COLING 2025 RegNLP RIRAG challenge focused on advanced information retrieval and answer generation in regulatory domains. We combined embedding models (Stella, BGE, CDE, Mpnet) with fine-tuning and reranking to retrieve relevant documents. Our novel approach, LeSeR, achieved strong results with a recall@10 of 0.8201 and map@10 of 0.6655. This work demonstrates the potential of NLP techniques in regulatory applications, particularly for retrieval-augmented generation systems, and identifies areas for future improvements in robustness and domain adaptation"

##### Abstract

This paper presents the system description of our entry for the COLING 2025 RegNLP RIRAG (Regulatory Information Retrieval and Answer Generation) challenge, focusing on leveraging advanced information retrieval and answer generation techniques in regulatory domains. We experimented with a combination of embedding models, including Stella, BGE, CDE, and Mpnet, and leveraged fine-tuning and reranking for retrieving relevant documents in top ranks. We utilized a novel approach, LeSeR, which achieved competitive results with a recall@10 of 0.8201 and map@10 of 0.6655 for retrievals. This work highlights the transformative potential of natural language processing techniques in regulatory applications, offering insights into their capabilities for implementing a retrieval augmented generation system while identifying areas for future improvement in robustness and domain adaptation.
